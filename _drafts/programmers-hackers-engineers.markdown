Programmers, developers, hackers, engineers... So many different terms the layman may naively confuse. Besides being all related to computers, those titles actually designate radically different roles, knowledge, and skill sets.

Definitions may tend to be subjective and personal. The term "hacker" is a famous example for [having a definition that varies among different circles as well as the wide public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_\(programmer_subculture\)#Definition). 

My objective here is not so much to give rigid definitions of those terms. I want instead to describe different tendancies in order to, I hope, help technical people (whatever their title), leaders and managers indifferently find their best fit.


#### Programmers

*Programmer* defines anyone who writes computer software. At its core, it consists of translating human thought into a language the machine can understand.

As you may know, there are thousands of programming languages. They differ in many ways, the most important being their purpose. For example, [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) specializes in querying databases, [R](http://www.r-project.org/) in statistics, while [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) excels in web development.

As you can imagine, there is a wide range of programmers, different by their language, not to mention their level of expertise.

To become a programmer, you need to learn one (of the many) machine language(s). If you want to do anything related with computers, the first mandatory step is to learn to program, even a bit (pun intended).   


#### Hackers

The *hacker* is really all about playful creativity. He is the [Homo Ludens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_ludens) of computer science. Hackers enjoy exploration and to push tools beyond the limits. Also, usually, hackers also favor deep understanding of details and revere knowledge and skills.

Note that the term *hacker* is sometimes erroneously used to designate people whose focus is to break computer security. Those people are in fact called "crackers".

Hackers are good in startups and in art: when hypothesis are yet to be confirmed, when speed is crucial, and to explore new possibilities.

And, yes, if you wondered, the creativity is the reason why we called ourselves the [Hackerloop](http://hackerloop.com/).


#### Developers

The *developer* is the hacker's rational twin. While there are some (debatable) differences between a *developer* and a *software engineer*, I will consider them similar in this article, for the sake of brevity.

The developer/engineer has both micro and macro approaches: paying attention to details while keeping an eye on the big picture. Like the hacker, he has a deep technical knowledge. But he also cares about the architecture, the methods, and the processes. 

So besides using the right language for a given purpose, an engineer will think of the performance, the maintainability, and the security, only to cite a few.

Regarding methods and processes, an engineer will look at the methodology, the communication between the members of his team, and minimize the number of bugs while increasing the speed of development.
 
Engineers are good in companies and in research: when performance and correctness are paramount, when there is a serious impact or scalability, and to optimize development.

We at [Hackerloop](http://hackerloop.com/), believe in iteratively (hence the *loop*), improving our methods and skills, as well as our products.


#### On titles and roles

Now this being said, I would like to give a few points.

First, a title is not the same as a role. This is true for degrees as well as company titles: someone might be officially called a programmer but might really deliver engineer-quality level work (or sadly, the other way around).

Second, hackers and engineers may be complimentary, or may succeed each other. For instance, a startup may need hackers to try hypothesis when starting, and may later need engineers in the growth phase.

It is possible to be both a hacker and an engineer. Schizophrenic dilemmas (like how to choose betwen speed of development versus correctness of code) are sorted out by keeping in mind the context and the current goals.


#### Beyond technical roles

Beyond the hacker and the developer, there are more managerial-like, but still technical, roles. They are often called lead developer or, at company-level, CTO ([Chief Technology Officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer)).

Leaders are not only concerned with the *how*, but also with the *why*. They understand the goals and the problems to be tackled and choose a corresponding technical solution. They work with different teams -- technical or not -- and their (sometimes conflicting) goals: like marketing wanting to increase the user base while QA wants to increase quality of the code. And all this by also taking in account the various constraints like budget, hiring, deadlines, and so on.

#### Finding the best fit

I hope this brings some perspective. First for the technical people, to better understand the role you are the most confortable with and which projects would be a good fit for you. And for managers, leaders, and clients, to figure what role you are really trying to fill in.

Now go make great things!
