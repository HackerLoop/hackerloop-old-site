    <h2>The bionic nerf blaster</h2>
    <p>
      After realizing it is too easy to win a Nerf battle over an adversary who lacks a hand, Hackerloop collective decided to make a bionic Nerf blaster that can be fired without one.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “It all started with jokes about the fact that it was too easy for us to win over him on nerf battle, as he miss his right hand”, explains Valentin Squirelo, founder of the Paris-based creative studio.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Using EMG technology (the science dedicated to evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles), a dismantled Swarmfire Nerf blaster, and affordable Arduino-like hardware electronics, it took the Paris-based collective two days to create a fully-functional prototype for their friend.

   <h3>Why make a bionic Nerf Blaster?</h3>

    <p>DIY hardware is not just about temperature sensors and automated door locks anymore. Every hardware component used to make this gun can be found online.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Electromyography is a great way to make the body communicate with hardware. We used it to detect electrical impulses and translating them into instructions for our gun. You could think of a thousand other use-cases.”
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      “You could think it’s not the first problem to solve for people with disabilities, but in fact being able to gave fun with your friends with these wonderful toys is also a real game changer,” Squirelo adds.
    </blockquote>

      <a name="what-did-we-do" class="anchor" href="#what-did-we-do"><span class="mini-icon mini-icon-link"></span></a>How it works</h3>

    <p>You’ll find a detailed rundown of the making of the prosthesis, but here’s the step-by step:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>1.</b> Three electrodes are positioned on different areas of the arm. Different inputs will allow to detect variations in muscular activity.</li>
      <li><b>2.</b> The voltage amplitude is transmitted (at the rate of approx. 100 per second) to the sensor which in turns transmits it to the microcontroller (Arduino-like).</li>
      <li><b>3.</b> The microcontroller is given a certain threshold. It collects the signals, and when the variation matches that certain threshold, it considers it a “fire signal”.</li>
      <li><b>4.</b> The signal is then transmitted to the modified Swarmfire gun, which has been modified to include a 3D-printed sheath and a custom casing.</li>
    </ul>
